## Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

- Initialize the weights of your CNN by sampling a normal distribution or by performing Xavier initialization so that a particular input signal does not get too big or too small as the network trains.
- In Notebook 4, create face filters that add sunglasses, mustaches, or any .png of your choice to a given face in the correct location.
- Use the keypoints around a person's mouth to estimate the curvature of their mouth and create a smile recognition algorithm .
- Use OpenCV's k-means clustering algorithm to extract the most common facial poses (left, middle, or right-facing, etc.).
- Use the locations of keypoints on two faces to swap those faces.
- Add a rotation transform to our list of transformations and use it to do data augmentation.
