- Completed Lesson 4
	- Day/Night image classifier from average brightness of an image
- Finished Concepts 1-13 of Lesson 5(Convolutional Filters and Edge Detection)
	- Filters and Edge Finding
	- Frequency and Fourier Transformation in images
	- High pass filters, sobel filters
	- Low pass filters, Gaussian filters
	- Analysed Fourier transforms of filtered and unfiltered images
- Started looking at the first project, Facial key point detection. Looked at transformations from the first notebook.

## Day 2: 3/10/19
