## Day 5: 6/10/19

Continued working on Facial Key Point detection project. Mainly Architecture defining and testing out layers.

## Day 6: 7/10/19

- Continued working on Facial Key Point detection project. Creatig architecture. Models don't seem to be learning well. Introduced dropout and BatchNorm.
- FInished Lesson 6.

## Day 7: 8/10/19

- Completed Lesson 7. Learned about ORB algorithm, including FAST and BRIEF algorithm and how ORB is scale and rotation invarient. Later learned about a more general object detection algorithm called HOG and played around with its implementation. Tried out various images and visualised intensity gradients.
- Worked on Project-1 and its architecture. Moved my project to colab and added GPU codes. Talked with mentor to get unstuck from project architecture issues. He mentioned some interesting points. Working on those.

- Finished Fashion MNIST classification. Tested out various architectures.

## Day 11: 12/10/19
- Completed Lesson 8. Learned about feature maps and their visualizations. Deconvolution to visualize deeper layers. A very interesting video on the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghEmQSxT6tw
- Also learned about about multiple tehniques on feature visualization like occlusion, saliency maps, guided backprop, visualizing the feature vectors by t-SNE and PCA.
- Part 1 Intro to Computer Vision 100%.

## Day 12: 13/10/19

## Day 14: 15/10/19
- Finished lesson 1 of advanced CNN architechtures. learned about R-CNN, fast and faster R-CNN. Looked at their implementations. Read a blog post of region proposals https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-for-object-detection-a-comprehensive-review-73930816d8d9

## Day 15: 16/10/19
- Finished Lesson 2 of second part. Learned about YOLO object detection. Sliding window, grid, anchor boxes, IoU and Non-Maximal Suppression techniques. Looked at YOLO implementation and tested various images. Perfectly detects objects! Observed changes with various threshold levels.

## Day 16: 17/10/19
- Topic 1-12 of Lesson 3 RNN's. Introduction to RNNs, RNN history, applications in NLP and CV. Refreshed Feed forward network, Backpropagation. Went through calculations of derivatives by hand for a small feed forward network.

## Day 17: 18/10/19
- Completed Lesson 3 RNNs. Revised RNN, how its calculations work, backpropagation through time. Pracriced the weights update calculation using bptt for a one or more than one rnn stacked layers.

## Day 18: 19/10/19
- Completed Lesson 4 LSTMs. A great revision on the inner workings of LSTM layers and its various gates. A short overview on GRUs. Ran a simple parts of speech tagger. Learned sequence batching for RNNs. Completed a character level sequence generator. Quite an exercise on various aspects of using lstm in an architecture!

## Day 19: 20/10/19
- Completed Lesson 5 Hyperparameters. Learned about various types of hyperparameters. Also details and common practices for each hyperparameter tuning. For hyperparameters of RNN, got introduced to some amazing papers and posts. Will start with them soon.

## Day 20: 21/10/19
- Working on the kaggle competition 'Alice'. Did EDA and worked on some features.

## Day 21: 22/10/19
