#30DaysOfUdacity #CVND

## Day 1: 2/10/19

- Completed Lesson 4
	- Day/Night image classifier from average brightness of an image
- Finished Concepts 1-13 of Lesson 5(Convolutional Filters and Edge Detection)
	- Filters and Edge Finding
	- Frequency and Fourier Transformation in images
	- High pass filters, sobel filters
	- Low pass filters, Gaussian filters
	- Analysed Fourier transforms of filtered and unfiltered images
- Started looking at the first project, Facial key point detection. Looked at transformations from the first notebook.

## Day 2: 3/10/19

-Completed Lesson 5(from 14)
	- Learnt and played with canny edge detector
	- Hough transformation and shape detection
	- Looked into materials for Bias in AI

## Day 3: 4/10/19

Lesson 6 conceps 1 to 4 completed
	- corner detection
	- dilation and erosion

## Day 4: 5/10/19

Worked on Facial Key Point detection model Architecture. Notebook 2.

## Day 5: 6/10/19

Continued working on Facial Key Point detection project. Mainly Architecture defining and testing out layers.

## Day 6: 7/10/19

- Continued working on Facial Key Point detection project. Creatig architecture. Models don't seem to be learning well. Introduced dropout and BatchNorm.
- FInished Lesson 6.
